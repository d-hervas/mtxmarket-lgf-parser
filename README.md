# mtxmarket-lgf-parser
Parser from the [Matrix Market format](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/mm/mm.html), as found in the [SNAP datasets](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/), to [Lemon's library lgf](http://lemon.cs.elte.hu/pub/doc/1.2.3/a00002.html).

I used this in the first versions of my final degree project. The chance of the whole file being useful to you is slim, but it might give you a few ideas / lines of boring boilerplate code to copy-paste.
